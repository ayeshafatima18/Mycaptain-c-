first question 
//Write a C++ Program to Find Size of int, float, double and char in Your System

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() 
{    
    cout << "Size of char: " << sizeof(char) << " byte";   //sizeof is the operator here; syntax : sizeof(data_type)
    cout << "Size of int: " << sizeof(int) << " bytes";
    cout << "Size of float: " << sizeof(float) << " bytes";
    cout << "Size of double: " << sizeof(double) << " bytes";
    return 0;
}

//Output of the programme will be 
//Size of char: 1 byte Size of int: 4 bytes Size of float: 4 bytes Size of double: 8 bytes

second question 
//Write a C++ Program to find the product of two numbers entered by the User

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  double a, b, ans;
  cout << "Enter two numbers: ";
  cin >> a >> b;
  ans = a * b;  
  cout << "Product = " << ans;    
  return 0;
}

//Output of the programme will be 
//Enter two numbers: 3.4 5.5 Product = 18.7
